# photo-sharing-redux

A simple React + Redux implementation of photo sharing platform. Built when I learnt this video [tutorial](https://learnredux.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos).

~~Now the app is deployed on [heroku](https://redux-photo-cn.herokuapp.com/).~~

Note: There are some sample data in the app for displaying purpose. They are fetched some json file stored at local and populated when the app 
is initialized. Because of that, these data are not **persistent** and any changes you make will be gone after refreshing.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:5000> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
